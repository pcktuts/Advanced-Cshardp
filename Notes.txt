DELEGATES = പ്രതിനിധി

English meaning: A person sent or authorized to represent others.


It's a very important and powerful feature in Csharp for creating realtime applications. 

If we want to pass a function as a parameter we can use Delegates.

A delegate is a reference type. But instead of referring to an object, a delegate refers to a method.

Declaring delegates means telling the compiler what kind of method a delegate of that type will represent. Then you create one or
more instances of that delegate. 

The syntax for declaring delegates is like this:

delegate returntype IntMethodInvoker(int x);
