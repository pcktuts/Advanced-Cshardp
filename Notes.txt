Lambda expressions 

We can use a lambda expression to create an anonymous function.

=> is called Lambda declaration operator.


Use the lambda declaration
operator => to separate the lambda's parameter list from its body.

A lambda expression is generally two types

1. Expression Lambda

Syntax:

(input-parameters) => expression

Returns the expression result, no need to add return keyword


2. Statement Lambda

Syntax:

(input-parameters) => { <sequence-of-statements> }

Doesn't return value implicitly
